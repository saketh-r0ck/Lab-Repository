135,claim: Now the biggest trend that we see in consumer behavior is definitely video.,"premises: [""And there's a strong technological underpinning for that, which is that if you go back five years and you tried to watch a video on your phone, it would probably have to buffer for a minute or so before you'd actually get to watch it, which wasn't a good experience."", ""And if you wanted to upload a video, whether it was a longer video like what you'd post to News Feed or a 10-second story like what you'd post in any of the apps, even that might take 30 seconds to upload, so it wasn't a good experience."", ""So now as the technology on the network level improves to support that, what we're seeing is the ability to serve what is a large amount of demand for what's a very engaging type of content."", ""And that demand flows across social content like we're seeing in Stories and Feed to clearly a huge amount of public content."", 'Pages are engaging in this, and some of the trends that Dave just talked about for just a lot of video behavior across the platform.']",2017,Q2,0
1360,claim: They're obviously both critical platforms.,"premises: ['Both have over 1.2 million monthly actives.', 'And WhatsApp has demonstrated significant engagement with crossing 1 billion daily actives.']",2017,Q2,0
2082,"claim: So, a combination of being able to understand the text that people message, read the articles that people would want to look at, watch the videos, look at the photos, are going to be great, too.","premises: [""And similarly, we want to be able look at a video and watch it and understand whether that's something that you're going to be interested in."", ""But there's no reason that we shouldn't be able to match you up with any of the millions of pieces of content that you might be interested in that gets shared on Facebook every day, except for the fact that we don't have the AI technology to know what those are about and if they match your interest today."", ""And you can imagine that today, we consider putting things in your News Feed that you're connected to in some way, right, that are from a friend or a page that you're following or that one of your friends likes.""]",2016,Q4,0
1805,claim: We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through.,"premises: [""We're very committed to China as a market."", ""We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know.""]",2015,Q2,0
1803,"claim: So that's the opportunity we see, whether it's -- for all front line, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, whether it's in healthcare.","premises: ['So in other words, it can be -- start with Teams.', 'It can start with some of our devices in the first-line worker.', 'For example, one of the things that we see the most traction for HoloLens is with first-line workers.', ""People in manufacturing and other in field service, where they were never issued a standard laptop or even a phone are being issued a HoloLens as their first computing device, and that's just because of the productivity it drives.""]",2019,Q2,0
1127,claim: So those are the natural places where you'll see us gain more developers and gain more traction.,"premises: ['And as you can imagine, our share is today in desktops, in emerging in tablets, in 2-in-1 and of course now with Xbox as well, which is you know got great attraction to gaming developers.', ""We are big believers in a unified developer platform and a unified Store, and then as Windows 10 monthly active devices increases and the Store usage increases, we'll see more and more developers take advantage of it."", 'In my opening commentary, I talked a little bit about both the increased visits to the Store and transactions as well as the fact that we are attracting new applications from developers like Netflix to Wall Street Journal to others.']",2016,Q2,0
953,claim: So that was another influence in Q2.,"premises: [""But the 51% year-over-year is also – it's a combination of the hiring we've done but also an adjustment we made to our estimated forfeiture rate."", ""We're seeing less forfeitures, which is a great sign for our employee retention, but you have to make adjustments to your reserves as you see that.""]",2017,Q2,2
744,claim: so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective.,"premises: [""On the content front, we're looking at investing in kick-starting an ecosystem for longer-form content on Facebook, and that involves us working with content providers to develop that content."", 'In the long run, we expect to see a revenue share model on the platform.', ""And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers,""]",2017,Q1,0
1564,claim: And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.,"premises: ['I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate.']",2015,Q4,0
1418,claim: There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially.,"premises: [""I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend""]",2016,Q2,1
435,"claim: As I go through different countries as I've been traveling lately, and looking at some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place.","premises: [""I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping."", 'I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side and the entertainment side.', 'I see business-related AR apps as well.', 'And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot.']",2017,Q4,0
677,"claim: The emerging markets which has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning,",premises: [],2015,Q1,0
1963,"claim: Really, Karl, what can drive that in addition to the overall gross margin improvement we talk about in the cloud, it's also really the strength we see in our Windows business.","premises: ['And I mean that not just in our OEM business but also across the commercial business for Windows.', 'That tends to have a very good margin profile.', 'And as we continue to improve the margin profile of our devices, we continue to see the OEM business health improve', 'And actually, we continue to see the growth in the consumer services around the transactions that run through Xbox is also good margin business for us that looks quite different than the hardware profile.']",2017,Q2,0
475,claim: We're very thrilled with the customer response to Prime Video.,"premises: ['Again, when Prime Video is used by our Prime members, it drives adoption and retention, higher free trial conversion rates, and higher renewal rates for subscribers.', 'So what we were encouraged by in Q4 was that globally we doubled the number of – our Prime members doubled the number of viewing hours of the Prime Video year-over-year.', 'And internationally, we had twice as member Prime members streaming year-over-year.']",2015,Q4,2
1414,claim: We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a healthy growth in third party.,"premises: ['On the international, on an FX neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4.']",2018,Q4,2
204,"claim: So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.","premises: ['So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things.', ""And so these whole communities have formed, which was somewhat surprising to us honestly, because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling."", ""It was for group communication and that's what people were using it for.""]",2017,Q1,0
143,claim: So there’s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it’s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration.,premises: ['And when we get to Q4 we’re going to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4 and that’s going to contribute to more of a decel in Q4 than we think we’ll see in Q3.'],2019,Q2,2
1192,claim: And our supply chain management is optimized for it.,premises: ['And we learned a lot with what is our workload diversity as well as our geo-diversity.'],2015,Q3,0
848,"claim: So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency, or how they can change the products and the business models and the products.","premises: [""The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome."", 'And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they are trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative.', 'There is machine learning in AI.', 'There is IoT.', 'There is new type of business process automation with operations.', 'All of that is transforming Maersk.', ""What thyssenkrupp has done in their Elevator business and other business units by using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it."", ""And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these."", ""And in that context, of course, they're lifting and shifting some of the older workloads, but they're modernizing the entire business process flow.""]",2017,Q3,0
2120,"claim: So we factor that in, and then there’s also two other issues.","premises: ['It’s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that’s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year.', 'The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year.', 'Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we’ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan.', 'I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.']",2019,Q3,1
238,"claim: Obviously, if you look at what we had launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we are launching a lot of new services.","premises: [""And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we’re launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches""]",2019,Q4,1
398,claim: and so this is the year where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital.,"premises: ['And then around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing completion of our new campus here in Cupertino,']",2016,Q1,2
791,claim: We remain very focused on the consumer experience there.,"premises: [""We do have the WhatsApp Business app, which is helping businesses connect with consumers, and that's growing well but that monetization opportunity is not available.""]",2018,Q4,0
1422,claim: And so that is really why we have the constraint that we have.,"premises: ['It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought.', ""The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it.""]",2016,Q2,0
2116,claim: So that answers the question around Q2.,"premises: ['As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially.', 'And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter.', 'The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points.', 'Obviously, that was also a negative.', 'And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM.', 'To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities', 'And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services.']",2017,Q2,1
2007,"claim: It's not going to have a material impact on revenue in 2016,","premises: ['We did begin shipping units in the quarter.', 'This is very small still.', 'VR is still very early.']",2016,Q1,2
1113,"claim: So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2.","premises: ['Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2.', ""So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%."", 'But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses.']",2019,Q2,2
1025,claim: The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to – is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook.,"premises: [""It's people finding post that their friends or others had posted in News Feed that they saw but then might want to go check out later.""]",2015,Q3,0
1786,"claim: What we try to do is get our community to tell us what matters to them,","premises: ['because we believe that we can get an accurate signal from the community then – people are smart.', ""They know what they want and what's good and they can tell us that, if we can ask them in a simple enough way and get aggregate data."", 'And the effect of that is that it basically normalizes for – there are going to be people who read a given news source, who will probably trust it because they read it.', ""And we've found that that's the reliable signal of content that helps to build common ground that is unlikely to be polarizing, that is unlikely to be false news, and what we're doing is helping to show that a little bit more.""]",2017,Q4,0
903,"claim: So at some level, I do think that the core mission and promise of helping to connect people with their friends and family is very fundamental, right?","premises: ['And everyone has friends and family and wants to stay connected and uses a variety of tools and ways to do that in the world today, which are often very inefficient, and the Internet offers new opportunities to make that a lot better.']",2015,Q2,0
575,"claim: So, one example of some of the things that we're excited about, again, are the click-to-Messenger ads.","premises: [""That's something we can put in News Feed in Instagram and Messenger and it both grows the ecosystem and creates a new opportunity for interaction.""]",2018,Q2,0
1006,"claim: But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid.","premises: ['Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server.', 'We obviously support that with all of our servers.', ""Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment right, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows Server, and you'll see that increasingly, even in this next wave of servers.""]",2016,Q3,0
403,claim: What we're hearing from publishers is that this is a good opportunity and they're pleased with the extensions we're making,premises: ['because it can make their ad serving and buying more efficient across the platforms they use.'],2015,Q1,0
1808,"claim: So your question about the AWS margins, that business as they continued to learn and as we continue to invent and get better at designing and operating the infrastructure and assets, we have been able to drive costs out of that business.","premises: [""So that's one of the primary drivers of the improvements that you see in margin year-over-year."", ""There's also an FX tailwind in there as well, which I think was about $60 million this quarter, which would contribute on a year-over-year basis, which really arises because we're largely priced in dollars, but have assets with local currency costs throughout the world.""]",2015,Q4,0
1836,"claim: So on the FX adjusted ARPU growth, I would just really point to the overall revenue growth rate, that's what's driving it.","premises: [""So you're coming up against a bigger business last year than we had in the past."", ""So you're seeing declining rate on that basis.""]",2015,Q1,1
1898,"claim: So what I would say is, I'm not sure about the breakthrough element of it.","premises: [""I would say it's just a demonstration of the very tight period where we – we've still added a lot, I mean, $4.6 billion is a lot of capital leases, but the rate of growth over last year is flat.""]",2018,Q2,1
937,"claim: So certainly, a lot going on in international, a lot that's really good, adding Prime subscribers at a high clip, continuing to add selection at FBA sellers.","premises: [""So you'll see devices, you see video content."", 'It may be getting there a little slower than the starting point in the U.S. but we see it really showing up in customer engagement and customer purchases.', 'On the AWS side, I think the 2016 to 2015 comparison probably stands on its own and 2014 falls by the wayside, so I would encourage you to look at recent trends.', ""So it's the whole array of Prime offering, Prime Now, Same-Day.""]",2016,Q1,1
674,claim: I would say it's a culmination of a lot of separate investments that we're making.,"premises: ['So if you look at the success of our devices, we are seeing tablets where we sold twice the volume in Q1 year-over-year.', 'Fire TV Stick, you may have read in our press release that it has greater than 100,000 customer reviews, the most reviewed product ever, 62,000 or over 62,000 of those reviews are five-star reviews.', ""We've not only had the Echo, but we have the Echo Dot and Tab, so we're branching off that product line and having trouble keeping those in stock."", 'And of course we launched the new Kindle Oasis e-reader.', ""As it is with digital content, you may have seen the recent announcements that we're working on a great amount of new content for Prime members.""]",2016,Q1,1
1275,"claim: So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers.","premises: [""International growth, your comment about slowing down, I think there's a slowdown versus Q3, if that was your point."", '28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales.', ""Although we've had Prime Day in most of those countries, it's really starting to gain more and more traction there."", 'So that is probably more of a help to Q3 than a discussion of any weakness in Q4.']",2017,Q4,2
1912,"claim: So we're pretty early in this whole thing and there's so much unique content that people share in Facebook that I think that that is the clear, unique opportunity to go for first, right?","premises: [""I mean there's – if you think about the overall web, there's a lot of public content that's out there that any web search engine can go index and provide."", ""But a lot of what we can get at are recommendations on products and travel and restaurants and things that your friends have shared, they haven't shared publicly, and knowing different correlations, or interesting things about what your friends are interested in, and that's the type of stuff, those are questions that we can answer that no one else can answer, and that's probably going to be what we continue to focus on doing first."", ""And I think what you're seeing is that as we enable more use cases and as we just get a lot of the basics right around performance and bringing the mobile features into parity and beyond what we've been able to do on desktop, the volume is growing quickly."", ""I think on a recent earnings call we just announced that we passed 1 billion searches total so now being more than 1 billion on mobile shows some progress that I'm pretty proud of for the search team.""]",2015,Q1,2
222,"claim: That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth.",premises: ['And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences.'],2018,Q3,0
1232,"claim: Obviously, that inventory was required","premises: ['because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter.', 'On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter.']",2015,Q1,2
1994,"claim: When we introduce ads into feed and continue to increase the ad load, we monitor really carefully.","premises: ['We’re looking at user engagement on the platform, we also look at the quality of ads.']",2015,Q4,0
395,"claim: So, obviously, the mix of products was very strong.","premises: ['Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49.', ""We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter."", 'Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter.']",2016,Q1,2
1044,"claim: But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.","premises: ['But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there.', 'It is already the third largest smartphone market in the world.']",2016,Q2,0
1109,claim: The way we look at it and the way we believe it works at least in our business is that customers will have a holiday budget and they will spend it between generally the middle of November.,"premises: [""It's creeping up to the early part of November through the holiday season."", 'And we do see obviously spikes in Black Friday and Cyber Monday and we also see relative tick-up in trends as we get closer to the holiday and for the shipping threshold cutoff.']",2019,Q4,0
793,"claim: So, yes, the short answer is that we're much more confident that we're going to get this right for the elections in the 2018, which include the U.S. midterms, but also the elections in Brazil and upcoming elections in early-2019 in India and the EU.","premises: [""And the reason why we're confident that we can get this right is because there have been several elections since the 2016 ones that have had much better results, including the French presidential election, the German elections, the Alabama special election, and the Mexican election about a month ago."", 'And in each of these – going back to 2016, we were – we have a very big security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those.']",2018,Q2,1
185,"claim: So on ad load, it's definitely up from where we were couple of years ago.","premises: [""I think it's really worth emphasizing that what has enabled us to do that is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads that we have, and that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all."", ""Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram.""]",2016,Q1,1
545,"claim: To step back again on that, our general philosophy is we want to find things - businesses that customers love, that can grow to be large, will provide strong financial returns, and are durable that can last for decades.","premises: ['We think Prime is that.', ""We continue to have healthy investments as we've stated across the globe."", 'We think marketplace is that.', 'We think AWS is that.', 'And we are constantly looking for a fourth or fifth business that fits that criteria.', 'As I said in Prime, the Prime platform, Prime features for customers, expansion for fulfillment capacity as we build out to support 26% unit growth in Q4, for instance and much greater FBA share, and not to mention all the investments in AWS, we are constantly looking for cost efficiencies and fixing variable productivity.']",2015,Q4,2
1489,"claim: From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there.",premises: ['Emerging markets ex-China were up 18% year on year.'],2017,Q3,1

741,"claim: But most people who come to News Feed and who come to Facebook today in general are trying figure out – they're trying to see what's going on with their friends, see what's happening in the world.","premises: [""They're not coming necessarily to engage in a specific type of video or specific community around video.""]",2017,Q3,0
1129,"claim: As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out.","premises: ['I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds.', 'We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to revenue.', 'Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago.', 'We’ve also said the manufacturing ramp that we’ve had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we’ve ever had.', 'And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat.', ""And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year."", 'One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile.']",2015,Q1,1
1166,claim: I would note we've been benefiting from continued growth across Instagram.,"premises: [""Instagram ad load in feed is at the same level as Facebook, so that would be – that's certainly been helpful in our recent quarters.""]",2018,Q2,2
732,"claim: In MPC, I generally expect he will continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year, that's not new.","premises: ['And so, I suspect you will see a similar pattern on a similar desire by Satya to continue to invest toward growth especially on the commercial side.', 'Use all the same mechanism last year through the year.', 'As we pivot from our phone business to some of our higher margin product.']",2017,Q1,0
1358,"claim: Again, I would say that we're very happy with the Prime membership growth and it has remained pretty consistent both in Q4 and then through Q1 and Q2 of this year.","premises: [""There's also – in that line item are also other monthly fees associated with some of our other subscription services like audiobooks, e-books, digital video and digital music.""]",2017,Q2,1
695,claim: And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter.,"premises: ['But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition.', ""It's a huge margin."", 'The loyalty rate that we have versus competition, an enormous gap there.', ""I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth."", 'I also see a market that over a five-year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 1.3 million in 2014 to over 1.9 billion – this is billion, rather, billion in 2019.']",2015,Q3,1
892,claim: We saw good acceleration in both North America and International this quarter.,"premises: [""North America was up 200 basis points sequentially and International was up 800 basis points and half of that you remember we've spoken about the impact of the Japanese consumption tax that was instituted last – April 1 of 2014"", 'It had a measurable impact on our run rate, our growth rate last year particularly Q2.', 'And so we are lapping that, which sequentially makes up half of the 800 basis points sequential gain.']",2015,Q2,1
211,claim: And we've taken down a lot of effort by different nation states to harm or interfere in elections that way.,"premises: ['The same goes for things around election interference and more proactively looking for inauthentic behavior.', ""So we're just going to go down the list of every basic type of bad content."", 'And we do report this publicly, going back to your question.', 'We issue a transparency report.']",2018,Q4,0

1832,"claim: Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency basis, and are sort of confident that you should continue to see that, as I said, into Q4 and then into FY 2019 as well.","premises: [""I tend to think about that as we'll have significant revenue growth in that segment."", ""We'll have significant gross margin dollar growth in that segment, and you'll actually continue to see operating margin dollar growth that's significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal."", ""If you think about gross margins in particular, what you'll see is Azure continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth.""]",2018,Q3,1

832,"claim: The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth.","premises: ['Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide.', ""So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that."", ""So there's a lot going on in international.""]",2017,Q1,1
1782,claim: But I like where we are.,"premises: [""Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results.""]",2018,Q3,2

1119,"claim: So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well.","premises: ['When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue.']",2017,Q4,1
170,"claim: So that's, I think, one of a number of factors.","premises: [""We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred.""]",2017,Q3,1
1595,"claim: And so, we're seeing consumers adopting that and we're building products for them.","premises: ['But what Mark alluded to was video is where people – as networks improve and devices improve and our products improve, video is the most engaging experience that we can offer.']",2017,Q2,0

1824,"claim: So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.","premises: [""You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring."", 'We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year.', ""I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth."", ""Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising.""]",2017,Q2,0

2013,"claim: Just on the 2019 expense growth guide, a lot of that is consistent with what we've been talking about as our big investment areas.","premises: [""If you look at just head count growth in the past year, it's up 45%."", ""So that compensation expense base that we're bringing into 2019 is really factoring into the overall growth guidance for the total expense guide, so that's a big factor there."", ""In addition, we've been investing significantly in CapEx, and those investments are starting to flow through the P&L in terms of depreciation."", ""And then I'd point to significant investment areas like AR/VR efforts, the content ecosystem around video, and the ongoing investment in safety and security.""]",2018,Q3,1

301,claim: And so we're very pleased with the kind of continued adoption and usage growth we've seen and obviously the benefits of AWS around their ability – customers ability to be nimble as a primary factor there.,"premises: ['Its probably is worth adding that, although prices are factor, the primary factor for customers choosing with AWS is really around their ability to move quickly and to be nimble and agile']",2015,Q1,0

758,claim: What we’ve definitely done over the last year and plan to invest even more in over the next year is worked hard on vertical specific targeting.,"premises: ['So for example for the telecom industry being able to target existing consumers with new consumers with people who are -- their voice plan or data plan’s about to expire.', 'With the auto industry, really important industry for growth for us, helping them figure out who their current customers are, who their potential customers are and where are the audience segments out there who have similar likes, interests, backgrounds, demographics to their current customers so that they can serve right ad to the right people.']",2015,Q4,1

882,"claim: And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we’ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365 and our CRM team online, I actually even have more confidence in our ability to attach and grow that gross profit over time.","premises: ['As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life cycle.', 'The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who used to deploy servers used to get only with IT departments of their own.', 'So as you move Office, it’s simply the first step.', 'So, even though obviously it comes at a little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up.']",2015,Q2,0
129,"claim: And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue.","premises: ['So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it.']",2016,Q4,1

367,"claim: So if you recall, it's very consistent with what we've been talking about the last couple of quarters which is the acceleration of expense growth is really driven by three factors.","premises: [""So it's the investments that we're making in safety and security, it's the content investments we're making to support Watch, and then finally it's the innovation initiatives around our longer term bets like AI, AR, VR and connectivity.""]",2018,Q1,2

1209,"claim: So, there's a lot of different influences there.","premises: ['But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh.', 'In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.', ""So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers.""]",2017,Q3,0
1910,claim: One thing that we're optimistic about is our ability to hire technical talent outside of the Bay Area as well as in the Bay Area.,"premises: [""And that's because we've built up engineering locations in key areas like Seattle, London, New York, Boston, Tel Aviv."", ""So we've got other markets in which we can recruit and grow engineering and other technical team."", ""And that's really different from where we were a couple years ago.""]",2016,Q4,0
172,"claim: And so, there was a lot of leverage and a lot of, in a way, there was a lot of pre hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018, while we still continue, in some areas, especially things like our core retail business and also G&A functions, but then we continue to invest again in the technology tied to AWS sales team to an AWS device area.","premises: ['Similarly on headcount, we grew headcount by 48% in 2016, 38% in 2017, if you exclude the acquisitions of Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 68% I believe.', 'Last year, we were at 14% growth.', 'So their groups are growing considerably higher than that 14%, but on total, the company grew 14%.']",2018,Q4,1
220,"claim: And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.","premises: ['If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan.']",2018,Q3,1
1328,claim: And during the quarter tactically the emerging markets had a bit of a rebound.,"premises: ['And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets.', 'We still declined on a reported basis.', 'India bounced back.', 'During the quarter, we returned to growth there.', 'We grew in Brazil as well.']",2019,Q3,2

688,"claim: And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging.","premises: [""So we think paid messaging, as we've talked about."", 'And WhatsApp is interesting because by virtue of paying, businesses are going to have to be careful about the content they send.', ""You're not going to send a lot of things people don't want to see if you're paying for them.""]",2018,Q3,0

277,"claim: Yeah, it was an incredible quarter.","premises: ['We were up 71% year over year.', 'China’s is obviously in the March quarter.', 'iPhone led the way.', 'It was up over 70% year on year.', 'And the current estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more than 9 points of share on a year over year basis.', 'The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China, and I’m particularly very happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%.', 'We set a record in China for revenues.', 'We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December.', 'And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter.', 'And so once again bucking the tide.']",2015,Q2,2

1656,"claim: And so, I'd see that is opportunity.","premises: [""When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it’s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year."", ""That's a large number.""]",2015,Q4,2

2166,"claim: And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.","premises: [""In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well."", ""So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views.""]",2017,Q1,0
