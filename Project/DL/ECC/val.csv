2159,"claim: And Heather, I would add that when you're using systems to look at content, when you're using AI machine learning systems, it's a real benefit to have actual people looking and tagging that content, classifying it","premises: [""because it helps those machine learning algorithms be able to learn what they're looking at.""]",2019,Q3,0
1894,claim: I think it was about GDPR and how that's gone relative to expectations.,"premises: [""We've seen adoptions around people who are opting out of allowing us to use context from the apps.""]",2019,Q3,0
1518,"claim: But really, I think the focus that we have here is how we can best execute no matter what the macro environment turns out to be, focus on our own execution, focus on continue to drive cloud services, focus on continue to drive annuity mix.","premises: [""Those movements actually and as we help customers transform, it's really the best plan in the face of any uncertainty, which you're clearly asking me about."", 'But I tend to probably focus more on what we can control versus the external environment and how we can best react to that.']",2016,Q2,0
717,"claim: And I talk about AWS revenue, again, we're – we are accelerating.","premises: [""We've accelerated for the last two quarters."", 'The FX-neutral growth was 48% in Q1, up from 44% on the same basis in Q4 and 42% in Q3.', 'And now nearly a $22 billion run rate.']",2018,Q1,2
386,"claim: And then secondly in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets.","premises: ['I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time.', ""If you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have paid $199 for – and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more than that.""]",2019,Q1,0
1558,claim: And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that and that’s obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it.,"premises: ['You have to consider the constant currency growth rates.', 'And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1.']",2015,Q4,0
667,"claim: There are -- it touches on a number of different parts of our business in terms of how we recognize revenue in terms of any aggregate, the impacts to our expectations for the revenue guidance for the first quarter.","premises: [""We did adopt a new standard in January 1 of this year, 2018, and you'll see that reflected in our financials for the first quarter coming up."", ""There's a number of different areas, at least, that we've called out in our filings with the 10-Q in the past and the 10-K that will be on file shortly that talk about the different areas that are impacted us.""]",2017,Q4,1
332,"claim: And so I think while I do understand that people will ask a lot about that price competition at the lower level, I think what you're seeing is","premises: [""because we're able to continue to move people up the stack, including all the way up to the business process layer, I think you'll continue to see us be confident in our ability to move and create margin and growth.""]",2017,Q3,0
2117,"claim: So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.","premises: ['On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing.', 'We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now.']",2017,Q2,1
1827,"claim: And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow.","premises: [""You're right, we've got an extra few days."", 'You know very well the launch timing is different.', 'You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago.', 'I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now.']",2016,Q4,0
1066,"claim: So, yeah, you will see more expansion from us.","premises: ['And on Whole Foods, yes, I believe the total is 465 stores or thereabouts.', 'And we have 12 bookstores now.', 'We are adding a few more in the near future in California, Washington DC, and Austin.']",2017,Q3,0
1767,claim: I think a lot of it is that we're getting better and better at ranking and showing people the content they want.,"premises: [""And part of it is that there's of course a bigger opportunity when people have their phones with them all the time, but I think that there are plenty of other worlds that we could be living in where we wouldn't have necessarily executed on that opportunity."", 'And the execution is hard, right?', ""And just kind of having something that's appealing universally to people wanting to stay connected with their friends, that's an important piece of it.""]",2015,Q2,0
721,claim: Our revenue growth during Q1 would have been four percentage points higher on a constant currency basis.,"premises: ['Obviously, what we’ve seen during Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies.', 'I would say during the course of the quarter the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar.']",2015,Q1,2
1711,"claim: This quarter we launched Canvas ads, which are very fast-loading, immersive mobile ads.","premises: [""They're easy to build."", 'You can use the self-service tool.', ""You don't have to write any code."", 'They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop-off you see when people click off to another site.', ""It's very early days, but the average viewing time is over 30 seconds,""]",2016,Q1,2

454,"claim: So we're still very pleased again with the international business, continue to invest in Prime benefits, international expansion as I just mentioned, and we're still seeing very good pickup.",premises: ['But I also point out that we launched Turkey in the quarter and now we have 17 Amazon websites globally.'],2018,Q3,2
513,claim: I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs.,"premises: ['Once we work through sort of the end of XP bump, that really should be in the line.']",2016,Q1,0
51,"claim: And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.","premises: ['For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.']",2016,Q1,2
1348,"claim: I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions.","premises: ['A lot of what we are still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth.', 'Now we have a good start with what is at the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5, some of the value we have.', ""Whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates."", ""And we're learning, we're improving, and we're pushing forward on that front."", ""At the same time, we're also introducing new SKUs for the front-line worker."", ""This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space."", ""It comes at a different ASP point, so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365."", 'We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business.', 'The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets.', 'And we finally get to do that with the service offering.', 'So those are all the areas.']",2017,Q3,0
373,"claim: And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to target -- to think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what we're doing.","premises: ['We thought about Instagram in the context of this new mobile camera space that was complementary.', 'If you remember, back then we were building the Facebook camera app.']",2019,Q3,0
1592,"claim: So it wasn't a material impact on the quarter, but we're excited, really excited to start working with the management team there.","premises: ['The deal closed in September.', ""They're very strong."", ""They've done a great job building a highly differentiated customer experience, just customer-centric like we are.""]",2018,Q3,2
535,"claim: And so as I look at that number, that suggests there’s plenty of upgrade headroom in addition to we want to keep inviting over as many switchers as we can.",premises: ['Our current estimate is that about 20% of the active installed base has upgraded to a 6 or 6 plus.'],2015,Q2,0
360,claim: There's a lot of movement of tech head count.,premises: ['And so there was less external hiring in the first half of this year.'],2018,Q2,1
512,"claim: We try to make it very easy for businesses to promote pages, promote posts and the like.","premises: [""And then of course, ads, we've got 60 million businesses with pages."", 'They manage those pages and then they can promote those pages via our easy-to-use ad products.', ""So that's an important on-ramp to mobile advertising for a number of businesses around the world.""]",2016,Q3,0
615,"claim: And so I actually feel quite good with that outperformance and our ability to see that outperformance fall to the bottom line through stronger executional gross margin percentage, particularly in that segment.","premises: ['We outperformed significantly in both those products in Q4, and that took us a little bit outside the COGS range but not as much as our revenue outperformed.', 'So actually, margins structurally were better than I thought they would be.', ""Because of the performance in Xbox and in Surface, you're right, it is a hardware mix shift a bit.""]",2015,Q4,2
361,"claim: So I think the first half of the year could be a good test of where our cost structure is, coming off of the investment that leads up to the holiday.","premises: ['Last year, there was a lot of first half investment.', 'If you look back on infrastructure and fixed head count that may be made that less pronounced.']",2018,Q2,1
154,"claim: And to your question about long form content, the more natural starting point for us is shorter form content which can either be social content or premium short form content.","premises: [""But some of – the vast majority of the content that's consumed on Facebook just talking about video right now is people browsing through feed."", ""They discover something interesting that they weren't necessarily looking for previously that's very powerful because that's a behavior that there isn't really anywhere else to do at scale on the Internet today in a great way, and then people watch it there or they bookmark it to watch later.""]",2015,Q3,0
521,"claim: For us, this is an important investment and it's very strategic.","premises: [""And you heard on this call me give a few examples of where we're already able to connect what happens in terms of ads with real sales of real products."", 'We are going to put the time in to make this work rather than look for any short-run specific return.']",2015,Q2,0
583,claim: The Wearables have done extremely well.,premises: ['It was acceleration further from the previous quarter.'],2019,Q4,2
554,"claim: And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem.","premises: ['As you know, as I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there six, nine months ago so.', 'And the majority of the iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there.', 'The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed and between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago.']",2017,Q4,1
1187,"claim: And then CapEx, we'll see continue to flow in through the P&L over time.",premises: ['And you already saw that pick up with the cost of revenue growth in Q4.'],2018,Q4,2
1319,"claim: I think, I guess, if you're talking about DAU and MAU, Europe is stable on that front in terms of Facebook overall.","premises: ['The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside.', 'And we had some impact from GDPR over the last two quarters.']",2018,Q3,0
1872,claim: and we remain extremely bullish on China and we're continuing to invest.,"premises: [""Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future."", ""It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently been volatile."", 'This could create some speed bumps in the near term.', ""But to put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% year-to-date, and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love."", 'Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow.', 'And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might.', ""And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated.""]",2015,Q3,1
438,"claim: In terms of web services, it’s obviously growing extremely fast.","premises: ['We saw some acceleration of growth from a revenue perspective.', 'Over the last few quarters here, usage is growing faster than that, so we will be deploying more capital as we go there.']",2015,Q1,1
489,"claim: So for purposes of 2016 modeling, I would use the Q1 rate.","premises: ['On the OpEx guide, Q1 came in slightly below our annual expense growth guidance, but we do expect that investments in areas like video and Oculus will impact the remainder of the year more substantially,']",2016,Q1,2
1111,claim: First of all on the -- there were two items we discussed last quarter with the Japan consumption tax raising from 8% to 10% effective October 1.,"premises: ['The net result was a pull forward of some purchases by Japanese customers into Q3 and also some negative elasticity effects post October 1.', 'The other item was Diwali timing, the Indian holiday which has a very large swing factor on international revenues is, it moved more into the third quarter this year versus -- in 2019 versus 2018.']",2019,Q4,1
1684,claim: And so we feel good about that.,"premises: [""From an absolute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are the highest that we've seen."", 'However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we called out in the past had an abnormally high upgrade rate.']",2017,Q3,1
1638,"claim: First of all, it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable LinkedIn to keep their product and cultural ethos of putting members first and innovating on their behalf.","premises: [""And that's what you see in their sessions growth, engagement growth, their quality member growth."", 'And obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions, talent solutions, and sales solutions.']",2018,Q3,0
356,"claim: As we look back on that, there were number of factors.","premises: ['I mean, in any quarter there can be product mix or ASP differentials which shift the unit growth figure, but if you also remember, we dropped our Super Saver Shipping threshold twice, the early part of last year from $49 to $35; and then down to $25.']",2018,Q2,1
344,claim: so we're very pleased with the results both in constant currency terms and nominal terms.,"premises: ['The acceleration we saw from Q3 to Q4 was currency for Europe, but Europe continues to grow at a very healthy pace on a constant currency basis,']",2017,Q4,2

2176,"claim: And clearly, as you said the idea of adding new services is very important to us.","premises: [""During the last three years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience."", ""We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely."", ""And we've added a very useful service to our developers."", 'We provide an advertising service for developers in the App Store.']",2019,Q1,1
870,"claim: So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow really well, it’s become a bigger and bigger part of our third party mix over the years",premises: ['I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.'],2015,Q1,2
1565,"claim: And on the question on capacity, – excuse me, cap – I'll address it as CapEx and capital leases, we're still seeing strong investment there.","premises: [""If I look at the quarterly trends, you're right, that this quarter was up 33% in isolation versus last year."", ""I look back to last year's first quarter and we grew 82% year-over-year."", 'So it was a particularly heavy quarter, particularly for investment in warehouses.', 'So if I step back on the trailing 12 months though, CapEx, which is predominantly tied to our fulfillment center network, is up 47%.', 'That is above the Amazon fulfilled unit growth rate, but we combined the strength of the FBA program and the space requirements as we get into bigger and bigger products.', ""On the capital leases, which is a good proxy for the spend to support the AWS business, that's up 49% year-over-year on the trailing 12 months.""]",2018,Q1,1
340,claim: And so the Watch had a more of a back-ended kind of a skewing.,"premises: ['On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May.', ""I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, but the June sales were the highest.""]",2015,Q3,2
1943,"claim: From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way.","premises: ['Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth.', 'But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions.', 'Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region.', 'So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.', ""But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3."", ""But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business."", 'On a dollar basis, we continue to grow – we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.']",2015,Q4,2
1985,"claim: And like Brian said, we like to be close to customers and benefit from having inventory close to customers as well.","premises: ['So we ended the year last year with 109 fulfillment centers around the world and 19 U.S. sort centers.', ""And typically we're looking at what the demand would be for peak as we figure out what we need;""]",2015,Q2,1
924,"claim: Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.","premises: ['And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad.', 'And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale.', 'And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June.', 'And so those points of sale pretty much, the overwhelming majority of the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter.']",2015,Q3,2
1640,"claim: So, yes, revenue synergies are showing up","premises: [""but mostly because product synergies are showing up, and that's because of the product ethos of LinkedIn around member-first is what we have maintained throughout this integration.""]",2018,Q3,0
1769,"claim: And I just think the team is doing a really good work on all of these, and I'm really proud of them.","premises: ['But I mean, the team has just done really good work in terms of ranking the content and making the experience faster and building out better ways to get feedback from our community on what kinds of content they want to see in News Feed and helping people have the tools that they need to share the social content and news and video content that they want so that way it exists in the corpus of content that can be shown.']",2015,Q2,0
1539,"claim: We're also focused on job growth, job creation over there.","premises: [""Since we launched over in India in 2013, we've created over 700,000 direct and indirect jobs."", 'So -- we also recently announced plans to create additional one million jobs in India by 2025.']",2019,Q4,0
1457,claim: So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems at scale is we start with the person-to-person user base.,"premises: [""So whether that's in messaging, it's people messaging their friends or groups and News Feed.""]",2016,Q1,0
1658,claim: So we are getting very good top-line growth.,"premises: ['5.1% operating margin was up from 3.9% in Q1 and 3% last Q2.', ""A lot of it is the top-line growth, but it's also a lot of the efficiency we're seeing, particularly on the fulfillment and marketing lines, which for the whole company were flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis."", 'A lot of that is fueled by Prime adoption and we are dropping a lot of it to the bottom line with many of the efficiency projects.', 'What I can say is that if you adjust for foreign exchange the operating margin is up slightly both sequentially and year-over-year.', ""What you're seeing there is also obviously colored by our investment our increased investment in India based on the momentum and the success we've been seeing there so far.""]",2015,Q2,1
1570,"claim: Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365.","premises: [""On the consumer side, as you noted, we are growing 1 million subs a month, and that's fantastic growth for us."", ""The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have a subscription relationship with us.""]",2015,Q4,0
1680,"claim: So, even if I see all the good things and good trends happening that I feel really create a great opportunity for us to sell Microsoft 365, you will see growth rates moderate next year.","premises: [""H2 where we've had really strong revenue growth and a really strong market will I think moderate growth wise, just because the base it was coming off in '17 was just a lot lower.""]",2018,Q4,0
88,"claim: We will do that overtime,",premises: ['because the amount is very large.'],2018,Q1,0
338,"claim: So obviously FX has been a significant hit in many ways, of course.","premises: ['I mean it reduces our growth rate.', ""We would be 800 basis points higher this quarter from the 33% that we've reported if it wasn't for the movement in currencies around the world."", ""And really when you look around the world, it's really if you exclude China, essentially every single currency has weakened against the dollar.""]",2015,Q3,0
1857,"claim: So the impression growth acceleration, you've got a couple factors going on there.","premises: ['One of the factors is just that the desktop roll-off is just continuing.', ""So as it gets smaller, it has less of a depressive effect on the overall impression growth number, because if you recall, desktop has quite a number of impressions per DAU, just given it's the right-hand column that has multiple impressions on each screen."", ""And obviously, Instagram is continuing to grow nicely as well, so that's another contributing factor there.""]",2018,Q1,0
63,claim: We're also seeing a lot of strength in brand.,"premises: ['So to share one example, Jack In The Box use our Canvas ads, which are very immersive ads.', ""They're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger."", 'They worked with agencies Horizon, David & Goliath and Adaptly, and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create two different custom audience groups.', 'One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads.', ""And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant purchasers."", 'They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those Canvas ads, so clearly people were really engaged in the brand experience of the ads, and they had a 13-point lift in add recall and a 9-point lift in purchase intent.']",2016,Q2,0
210,"claim: And I think in the last six months or a year alone, there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where we're we've been able to get first responders to people when they needed help","premises: [""And that's an area where the goal isn't to take down the content, but if we see an area where - if we see something that a person might be thinking about hurting themselves, we now have thousands of people and technical tools that can flag this content to those people to - so we can actually go get first responders to go reach out to people."", 'because of this approach of being more proactive on looking at the content.']",2018,Q4,1
2022,"claim: And to your specific question, Heather, on the impact of some of the price increases that went into effect in Q2, I'd say it's a couple of points.","premises: [""The overall number, even if you take a couple points off that 28% is a very good performance, that I believe to Satya's point, is the impact you've seen of the very aligned technology road map on the architecture plus a business model that matches it.""]",2019,Q1,0
1691,"claim: And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a mature penetration.","premises: [""The -- what we're seeing in terms of new adds on the Watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments is about three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch.""]",2019,Q4,0
661,"claim: Just quickly on the ASC impact, Brian mentioned earlier that of course we've been talking about it all year the changing, and the subscription revenue recognition is now straight line.","premises: [""So on a comp basis you'd expect to see subscription revenue be about $300 million lower due to that accounting change."", ""The other piece that we hadn't talked about is the reclass that we gave in the past few quarters, specifically around the advertising services that have moved from Contra COGS into other revenue beginning in 2018."", 'That was about $750 million increase to that other sales revenue category here in the third quarter.']",2018,Q3,1
1739,claim: In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction.,"premises: ['And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance.', 'And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business.', 'But really some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought', 'Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded.']",2016,Q1,2
48,claim: We had – what I attribute it to is continued strength in our – some of our most profitable areas.,"premises: ['AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth.', 'Advertising also had strong growth.', 'Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs.', ""You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.""]",2018,Q2,2

606,"claim: But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.","premises: ['We clearly saw that this year.', ""There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about.""]",2016,Q4,1

1646,claim: A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business.,"premises: ['So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity.', 'But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year.']",2017,Q1,1
514,"claim: So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that.","premises: [""The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis."", 'That was 70% cloud minus 8% on prem.', ""That's a trend that's not new for us."", ""We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base."", 'New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side.', ""Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling."", ""And then in terms of renewals, they're quite good, which we talked about.""]",2016,Q1,0

544,"claim: The deceleration you're seeing of 700 basis points is more a function of the Prime Day that we had in Q3, if you remember.","premises: [""We didn't break it out by segment, but we said that Prime Day contributed 200 basis points to our Q3 run rate, revenue growth rate."", 'So sequentially last year, any North America EGM we dropped from 31% to 27%.', 'So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4.']",2015,Q4,1
1154,"claim: So I would say right now, it's more about efficiency and also performance of the advertisement themselves.","premises: ['The other revenue growth that you see does include some non-advertising things as well.', 'So while other revenue grew 36%, and it is principally advertising, advertising grew a bit higher than that.']",2019,Q1,0

1953,claim: We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth.,"premises: [""And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half.""]",2017,Q1,0
